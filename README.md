# Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using LSTM

This project predicts stock market behavior using historical data and an LSTM model built in PyTorch. It learns patterns from the past 90 trading days using features such as price, volume, and moving averages. A sliding window approach is used to capture both short- and long-term trends, with training performance monitored using validation loss.
